# Notes: Log Structured Merge Trees

Files are stored onto disk, in-memory you store the set of changes to a file. Once the memory is full, these changes are moved to the filesystem. Files are not updated, but instead new files are created.

Writes are always fast because they are always in-memory, we keep indexes of the data in memory too so reading becomes easy.
